## Lung Capacity Classification using ML

- Problem Statement
Classify children's lung capacity into "High" or "Low" using features like Age, Height, Gender, Smoking, and Caesarean birth.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle - Lung Capacity of Kids
- 725 samples, 6 features
- No missing data found

## Steps Performed
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Classification Label Creation
- Baseline Model Setup (Decision Tree)

##  Model Plan
- Classification models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV (Week 4)

##  Deliverable Link
This repository is part of my ML Internship project for Week 3â€“4.
